# How to Run and Deploy the Picture Finder App #

## Overview of the app ##

Use the IBM Bluemix Location services and Instagram to find pictures near an address.  It's written in Node.js and uses the following Bluemix services:

- Pitney Bowes Geocoding service

## Deploying the App and Binding the Geocoding Service ##
Multiple methods exist for interacting with the BlueMix platform. Outlined below are two of those methods:

1. [Command-Line](#method-command-line) 
2. [ IBM DevOps Services](#method-ibm-jazzhub)

### Method: Command-Line ###
#### Prerequisites ####

Before we begin, we first need to install the [**cf**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) command line tool that will be used to upload and manage your application. If you've previously installed an older version of the cf tool, make sure you are now using v6 of cf by passing it the -v flag:

    cf -v

#### Steps ####
In the terminal, go into the directory named **app**, and follow these steps.

1. Login to Bluemix.

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf login [-a API_URL] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE]`|
   |------------|----------------------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net`   |

2. Go to the Bluemix UI and create an instance of the Pitney Bowes Geocoding service.  As part of the service creation you'll need to create a Pitney Bowes developer account and application.

3. **From the directory that houses the _app.js_ file** (not from the root directory that contains this *README.md* file), push the app with the --no-start option so we can bind our required service before starting.  Pass the -c flag to specify the start command that should be used by CloudFoundry to run your app.  Be sure to give your app a unique app name to be used for its hostname; for instance the example below would result in http://picturefinder-jayallenmn.ng.bluemix.net.

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf push APP [--no-manifest] [--no-start] [-c COMMAND]`                |
   |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf push picturefinder-<username> --no-manifest --no-start -c "node app.js"`                |

4. Bind the Geocoding service instance you created previously to the new app

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf bind-service APP SERVICE_INSTANCE`|
   |------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf bind-service picturefinder-<username> Geocoding-demo`|

5. Start the app

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf start APP`                 |
   |------------|----------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf start picturefinder-<username>` |
   

### Method:  IBM DevOps Services ###
1. Browse to the  DevOps Services project repository located [here](https://hub.jazz.net/project/jstart/Picture%20Finder%20%28Node%29/overview).  Click on **Edit Code** for the project.
2. Click on "Fork".  This will provide you with a personal copy of the code within your DevOps Services project space.
3. Located in the **app** directory of the project, edit manifest.yml and change the host name to something unique and the service name
to the name of your already-created Geocoding service.
4. Also located in the **app** directory, edit app.js and replace the Instagram ID and secret with your ID and secret.
5. Next, click on "Deploy".  This will use information within the **manifest.yml** to deploy the sample application directly into the codename: BlueMix platform.


  You may continue to deploy changes to your BlueMix application directly from DevOps Services using the "Deploy" and "Deploy As" buttons.

5. Next, click on the Root Project Name and scroll to the **Manual Deployment Information** section.


  You can check the status of the app using this section. If a green filled circle is visible, you may click the Application Name shown within the section and interact with the running application.  However, if a red filled circle is displayed, you may click **Manage** and directly interact with the BlueMix User interface for further investigation and debugging.
